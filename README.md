# Intro to Python Final Project - Randomizer Games
### by Kayla Palm
#### This project features three different games, all which take in user input and utilize number randomization.
---

### Games:

**Higher Lower**
- A number between 1 and a number of your choice will be randomly generated.
- This number will be revealed to you.
- After this number is revealed, a second number will be generated.
- In order to gain a point, you must guess if this unknown second number is higher or lower than the first number.
- If guessed incorrectly, the computer gains a point.
- The first to reach 5 points wins.
  
**Heads or Tails**
- In this game, you will start with 250 credits.
- Each round you will bet an amount and guess if a flipped coin will land on head or tails.
- The computer will also be playing with its own credits.
- To win, reach 1000 credits before the computer.
- If you or the computer reach 0 credits, the other wins automatically.
  
**Guess the Number**
- In this game, you will have to guess a number within a range you select.
- You will be told if your guess is higher or lower than the value.
- You can choose to play with a limited amount of guesses or not.
